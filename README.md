Idea : **Decomposing a compact triply eclipsing hierarchical triple star system into its composite pairs** using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram technique (a direct extension of classical Fourier analysis for unevenly sampled time series data in astronomy).
Used an artificially simulated system, a simulated system inspired from a real system EPICâ€‰249432662, and the real data of this system.
Drew inspiration for this analysis from reading about the properties of stars in multi star systems, which are determined by the mutual gravitational influences.
A recent discovery of the orbiting partner of Betelgeuse, based on the Great Dimming event (S. B. Howell et al., 2025), further piqued interest.
